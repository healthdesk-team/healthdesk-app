# **HEALTH**DESK

**HEALTH**DESK is an application developped to improve and simplify the patient follow-up during his pre and post hospitalization.

## Tech Organization

Each part of the application is located in its own Github repository :  
-> [Healthdesk front-end](https://github.com/healthdesk-team/healthdesk-app)  
-> [Healthdesk back-end](https://github.com/healthdesk-team/healthdesk-back)  

We are using Github Projects as our main project management tool to support our SCRUM methodology. Again, each part of the application has its own Projects :  
-> [Front-end boards](https://github.com/healthdesk-team/healthdesk-app/projects)  
-> [Back-end boards](https://github.com/healthdesk-team/healthdesk-back/projects)  

> In order to keep our workflow as smooth as possible, each step of the SCRUM methodology has its template

## Front-End
The application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Since we are following the rules of the **Test Driven Developpement** (TDD) we are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/) to avoid regression in our code base.  
Regarding our components system, we are using the [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) convention to sort our components wich are based on [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for React. They are styled by [CSS-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and variables in the `constants` folder.

Our code base is of course linted following the famous [airb&b](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide for the JS part and [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) standard regarding the CSS.

When pushing code on Github the commit is submited to our Continous Integration system, [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), that will run the tests and lint the code on it. It will give the green light that everything is fine and could be safely submited to the dev branch. 

### Main dependencies
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org) to manage data flow and global state
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started) for date manipulations
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/overview/api) for the internationalization of the app
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/) in case we need some nice arrays and collections manipulations

### Scripts
`start` to launch the app  
`build` as the command name tell  
`test` run Jest in watch mode, must run when developping  
`test:ci` run all the tests with a code coverage output at the end  
`lint:js` point the linting errors in the code base  
`lint:css` same but for the style part  
`eject` to eject and customize the webpack config

## Back-end
Our back-end rely on [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) wich is a Back-end-as-a-Service kind of app but selfhosted. It is a REST API in NodeJS and MongoDB. All the tech doc regarding to routes and stuff will be hosted elswhere and written any time soon.

## How to run the stack
_* Note that you should have Git, Docker and mongo-tools up and running before_
> Run the following command to get started :
```
git clone git@github.com:healthdesk-team/healthdesk-app.git \
git clone git@github.com:healthdesk-team/healthdesk-back.git \
cd healthdesk-app && npm i \
cd .. && cd healthdesk-back/src && npm i
```
To launch the back-end, at the root of the repo : `docker-compose up`

Then ask one of the main contributors to have a proper dump of the DB. Once you have it :
`mongorestore --host 127.0.0.1 --port 27017 --db healthdesk [PATH TO THE DUMP]`

To launch the front-end, at the root of the repo : `npm start`
